1. Find out how many tasks are in the task table
   SELECT count(id) AS "Total number of Tasks" FROM task;
   Ans = 35 tasks

2. Find out how many tasks in the task table do not have a valid due date
   SELECT count(id) AS "No valid due date" FROM task WHERE due_date IS NULL;
   Ans = 8 tasks

3. Find all the tasks that are marked as done
   SELECT task.title, status.name FROM task INNER JOIN status ON task.status_id = status.id WHERE status.name = "done";
   Ans = 12 rows displayed

4. Find all the tasks that are not marked as done
   SELECT task.title, status.name FROM task INNER JOIN status ON task.status_id = status.id WHERE status.name != "done";
   Ans = Total 23 rows returned
   
   SELECT task.title, status.name FROM task INNER JOIN status ON task.status_id = status.id WHERE status.name = "In Progress";
   Ans = In Progress - 15 rows returned
   
   SELECT task.title, status.name FROM task INNER JOIN status ON task.status_id = status.id WHERE status.name = "Not Started";
   Ans = Not Started - 8 rows returned

5. Get all the tasks, sorted with the most recently created first
   SELECT * FROM task ORDER BY created DESC; 

6. Get the single most recently created task
   SELECT * FROM task ORDER BY created DESC limit 1; 

7. Get the title and due date of all tasks where the title or description contains database
   SELECT title , description, due_date FROM task WHERE title LIKE "%database%" OR description LIKE "%database%";
  
8. Get the title and status (as text) of all tasks
   SELECT task.title, status.name FROM task 
   INNER JOIN status ON task.status_id = status.id;
  
9. Get the name of each status, along with a count of how many tasks have that status
  SELECT status.name AS "Status", COUNT(task.status_id) AS "Count of Status" FROM status
  INNER JOIN task ON status.id = task.status_id GROUP BY STATUS;

10. Get the names of all statuses, sorted by the status with most tasks first
   SELECT status.name AS "Status" , count(task.status_id) AS "Count" FROM status 
   INNER JOIN task ON status.id =  task.status_id GROUP BY STATUS ORDER BY Count DESC;
